# Polling App: Part3

## Application Success

Great job! Professor Smith was able to get poll results for over 40 technologies!

## Requirements

The ability to add new technologies to the poll worked so well, that Professor Smith was able to add tons of new technologies to the poll!
However, she let us know that this has caused another problem. It is difficult for her to find technologies in the list. She wants to continue
using the app for the next conference, but really needs to find a solution for quickly finding technologies in the poll.

## Implementation

We think that two solutions should handle this nicely, and Professor Smith agreed. First, the technology results should be sorted. Professor Smith said that
she doesn't care about capitalization and she wants all related technologies to be shown together. So, anything starting with "J" should show together, regardless of 
case. This, then, should be a case-insensitive sort. 

We also suggested adding a filter, and she though this was a great idea. There should be a filter toggle (can be a button) that will initiate a "filter mode". While
filtering, any text entered into the input box will serve as a live filter on the technology list. Also, all other functionality (add, delete, increment, decrement) should
still function while the filter is active. Since she doesn't care about casing, the filter should be case-insensitive as well. There should be a "clear" button that shows when the filter is active that will turn filtering off.
